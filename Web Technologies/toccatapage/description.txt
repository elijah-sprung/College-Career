As per the instructions for this project, this is the small description of my site and how I went about creating it. One of my main design issues that came about as I began creating a site for my A Cappella group was following the established brand that we already had. Thankfully, one of my other group members gave me a file that I included in the “references” folder that contains the hex codes and font name for everything used in Toccatatones media. I tried to make my site gracefully decline in quality, but I am afraid that I simply do not have enough experience with all of the amazing aspects of CSS and HTML in order to do so proficiently. Hopefully, I can learn more as I continue to develop this site so that I can actually publish it and use it for my group.
